Non-equilibrium dynamics makes it very complex to predict the effect on intracting species

BITH
A threatened bird species whose distribution is patchy and restricted to high elevation dense balsam fir forests
- Most of its canadian populations in Qc
- At risk; Extremely restricted distribution
- Climate change could pose a major threat to the persistence of this species in Canada as favourable climatic conditions within habitat patches could shrink rapidly

Studying BTIH dibution dynamics
- Metapopulation dynamics describe the ability of BITH to occupy suitable patches, which may be important in its response to climate change
- BITH may be *particularly vulnerable to climate change*
- I modellized BITH's favourable habitat
- I compare BITH favourable landscapes under **climate-only** change and **climate-induced forest** change scenarios

# Distribution dynamics

## Favorable landscape shifts predict non-equilibrium dynamics

.center[![:scale 100%](assets/img/map_BITH_2100.png)]

???

BITH : Projections main results
- **Climate shifts faster** than forest composition
- **Non-equilibroin dynamics**: **Persistence** where BITH is already present despite **less favorable conditions** (extinction debt), but **no northern-expansion** (colonization credit)

# Distribution dynamics

## Spatial structure is affected by climate change

<br>
.center[![:scale 90%](assets/img/spatial_configuration.png)]

???

As the metapopulation dynamics may be important in determining distribution change to climate change, I then looked into the change in spatial structure of the favorable landscapes

**Patch area, connectivity, and habitat amount can be differently affected by climate warming**

Landscape **connectivity** was affected by newly suitable habitat patches, the extinction of the smallest habitat patches, the fragmentation of the larger ones, and the dispersal distance

???

But **capacity diverges under limited dispersal**

**Persistence** could not be explained by changes in **habitat amount alone**

That is because the species’ ability to **use all available habitat** is affected by **dispersal**, which **habitat amount alone does not represent.**

1. Habitat mismatch affects species distribution shifts

???

The concepts developed here are **more general** than the specialist-habitat context

- BITH is likely to **persist** despite **unfavourable climatic conditions**
- **Non-equilirbium** dynamics are to be expected


--

2. Metapopulation dynamics may precipitate species decline

???

<br>

- **habitat shrinking** + **connectivity loss** = **precipitated range contraction**
- **persistence** of this species under climate change to be fundamentally affected by **metapopulation dynamics**

## .large[.orange[The metapopulation structure is a vital element to distribution change]]

???

Our results support the importance of **integrating** both **habitat amount** and **landscape spatial structure** in mechanistic distribution **modelling**
