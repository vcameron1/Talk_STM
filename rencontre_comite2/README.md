## Abstract

Climate warming will likely cause an ecological redistribution of species because species distribution is tightly related to environmental gradients. For species who's distribution is influenced by the distribution of another species, biotic interactions may modify the relationship between its distribution and climate. Although biotic interactions are known to shape species distribution, there is no concensus on how they do so at large spatial scales. While classic correlative species distribution models do not account for biotic interactions, here I will model the change in distribution of passerine birds interacting with a forest habitat also responding to climate warming to identify mechanisms that may cause non-linear responses to climate warming. Using a spatially explicit metapopulation model, I will evaluate the effects of landscape fragmentation, topographycal position of species distribution, species dispersal, and responsivity of the biotic habitat on species' distribution response to climate warming. This model explicitely intergrates biotic interactions, and will provide new insights on species response to climate warming, but also be of great interest to conservation organizations providing future distributions for forest habitats and passerine bird species. I hope the model will help Corridor Appalachien to acheive their conservation objectives by proposing valuable direction for their conservations resources.

## How to get a pdf version

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Export-Slides-to-PDF) dealing with this. I personnaly use [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) like so:

```
decktape --no-sandbox file:///path/to/index.html /path2/to/talk.pdf
```
